= Dealing with Toleration

<span style="color: #E3000F;">**SPD**</span> is currently acting as external support to the government of Chancellor [+ chancellor +]. Still, they want to somehow use their position.

We have called for a vote of no confidence, and have brought down this government. Chancellor [+ chancellor +] currently rules as acting chancellor.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

title: Urge the coalition against austerity politics, and to increase social spending.
choose-if: budget >= 1
unavailable-subtitle: This can only happen with a budget surplus.
go-to: urge_success if dvp_relation >= 30 and z_relation >= 40; urge_failure if dvp_relation < 30 or z_relation < 40

@urge_success
on-arrival: welfare += 1; budget -= 1; workers_spd += 5*(1-dissent); unemployed_spd += 5*(1-dissent); z_relation -= 3; dvp_relation -= 3; reformist_dissent -= 5; center_dissent -= 5; labor_dissent -= 5;

We have successfully urged the coalition parties to increase social spending! Unfortunately, the center-right parties increasingly see us as a nuisance, and might not wish to continue these negotiations.

@urge_failure
on-arrival: z_relation -= 3; dvp_relation -= 3

Unfortunately, our negotiations have met with failure. The center-right parties increasingly see us as a nuisance, and might not wish to continue these negotiations.

Our negotiations have succeeded, and the SPD has agreed to form a new coalition government with us!

They are now part of a "constitutional coalition" government that includes all republican parties. [+ chancellor +] will remain as chancellor. Radical rightists in our party are skeptical of this arrangement.

- @election_1928.ministries: Now, we must select our ministries.

We will refuse their demands. This may not end well, though...
