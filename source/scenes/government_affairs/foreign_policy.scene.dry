@improve_west
title: Improve our relations with the Western Allies.
on-arrival: west_relation += 2; reparations_negotiation += 1

The key to peace in Europe is a rapproachment between France and Germany. We are taking steps towards that rapproachment. [? if young_plan_seen == 0 : This is difficult to do when France is occupying a major portion of Germany's territory, but we are working on that part. ?]

@improve_east
title: Improve our relations with our eastern neighbors.
on-arrival: east_relation += 2;

We also aim to improve relations with our eastern neighbors, Poland and Czechoslovakia, who are righfully terrified of German aggression. Hopefully we can convince them of our peaceful intentions.


@customs_union

The right has long desired closer ties with Austria, with the eventual goal of the merger of the two German-speaking countries. A customs union with Austria is the first step towards this goal. Additionally, many believe that a union with Austria would improve our current economic circumstances.

However, the Allies, especially France, are likely to object. This agreement would break the terms of the Versailles Treaty, and could lead to economic sanctions, further hurting our economy.

- @customs_union_2: Yes, do it!
- @fp_menu: No, we should do something else.

We have formed a customs union with Austria! The right-wing parties are praising us for this unexpected turn of events.

Immediately, France and other neighboring countries lodge their protests. The longer-term response is yet to be seen.


@negotiate
title: Negotiate regarding our remaining obligations from the Treaty of Versailles.
subtitle: [? if young_plan_seen == 1 : After passing the Young Plan, France has committed to withdrawing from the Rhineland. Now, we must see if they can reduce our reparations further, given the economic depression. ?]
view-if: reparations > -2 and reparations_negotiation < 3
on-arrival: west_relation += 1; reparations_negotiation += 1; reparations_negotiation += 1 if pacifism >= 3; reparations_negotiations += 1 if nationalism <= 50; reparations_negotiation += 1 if west_relation >= 3

Negotiations procede smoothly for the most part. The Western powers are convinced of Germany's sincerity and goodwill.


@reduce_reparations
title: The Western Allies are finally willing to pause our reparations payments!
subtitle: Our negotiations have been successful.
view-if: reparations_negotiation >= 3 and black_thursday_seen == 1 and reparations > -2

max-visits: 1

Finally, given both the economic circumstances and our continued negotiations, the Western Allies are willing to pause our reparations payments! Much of the credit must go to American president Hoover, who has been friendlier towards us than the Europeans.

This has reduced tensions within our government, and our party has gotten credit for the achievement.

@expose
title: Expose the secret rearmament plans of the previous foreign ministry!
view-if: rearmament_exposed == 0
on-arrival: west_relation += 2; east_relation += 1; nationalism -= 5*(1-dissent); pro_republic += 5*(1-dissent); coalition_dissent += 1; rearmament_exposed += 1; reparations_negotiation += 3; coup_progress += 2

The previous foreign ministry, despite its benevolent and peaceful face, was secretly helping the Reichswehr to build up its forces, in contravention of the Treaty of Versailles.

The Allies are grateful of our exposure and repudiation of militarism. Our partners in the coalition are less supportive.


@concordat_negotiate
title: Negotiate a Concordat between the Germany and the Vatican.

on-arrival: reichskonkordat_progress += 2; reichskonkordat_progress -= 1 if abortion_rights; reichskonkordat_progress -= 1 if family_law; z_relation += 3*(1-dissent); nationalist_dissent += 5

The Roman Catholic Church is interested in furthering relations with the German Republic, seeing us as preferable to the old anti-Catholic policies of the Empire. We are working towards the signing of a Concordat, an agreement between the Vatican and the Republic that formally recognizes the Church's rights and interests in the country. The Center Party is especially interested in making this agreement.

[? if family_law : Our liberalized divorce policies make it difficult to build relations with the Vatican. ?] [? if abortion : Our legalization of abortion make it difficult to connect with the Church. ?]

on-arrival: reichskonkordat = 1; z_relation += 15*(1-dissent); catholics_dvp += 8*(1-dissent); nationalist_dissent += 8;
achievement: reichskonkordat

We have successfully signed a Concordat between Germany and the Roman Catholic Church! This treaty defines a formal relationship between the Church and the German state, guaranteeing freedom of worship for Catholics, and the right of the church to appoint their own clergy. Catholics in Germany are pleased, as are their representatives in the Center Party.

view-if: austrian_parliament_seen = 1 and austrian_civil_war_seen = 0
on-arrival: sdapo_strength += 1; left_dissent -= 3; center_dissent -= 3

We provide verbal backing to Austrian democracy, wage a war of words against Austrofascism, and promulgate additional trade sanctions. Time will tell if it will be enough.

In public, we provide verbal backing to Austrian democracy, wage a war of words against Austrofascism, and promulgate additional trade sanctions. Privately, we provide financial and various forms of "support" to our comrades in Austria in their struggle against dictatorship.

choose-if: west_relation >= 5 and east_relation >= 4
on-arrival: eu_progress += 1; west_relation += 1

Forming a "United States of Europe" has long been part of the Social Democratic foreign program. Finally, we are taking steps towards it. Given our positive relations with the other countries of Europe, we can begin to hold multilateral negotiations for more European federalism. It will take time to hammer out the exact shape of this future "European Union", however.

achievement: eu

Along with France, Great Britain, and many other states of Western and Eastern Europe, we have signed a treaty to form a European Union! It is hoped that Europe has learned the lessons of the Great War; never again will there be another war that tears the continent apart.

A major component of the union is the free movement of people and goods across the countries of Europe, as well as the stabilization of currency exchange rates. This provides new markets for German products and new sources of investment.

Fascist Italy remains a problem, and the Soviet Union also lies outside the system. But for now, there is new hope for peace and prosperity throughout the continent.
