= Businesses Lose Confidence

Because of our government's policies, which are perceived as anti-business, the capitalists are reducing their investment and laying off workers. This has the immediate effect of raising unemployment and dissent against our government, especially among the middle class.

The business community has a variety of suggestions as to how we might improve the business environment.

- @taxes: Cut taxes for the upper brackets.
- @welfare: Reduce welfare and social spending.
- @nothing: We will not take any action for now.
- @watch: Just watch us. The economy *will* improve.

@taxes
on-arrival: upper_tax_rates -= 1; budget -= 1; capital_strike_progress -= 1; unemployed -= 1; new_middle_dvp += 5*(1-dissent); old_middle_dvp += 4*(1-dissent); spd_relation -= 5; coalition_dissent += 1 if in_weimar_coalition or in_grand_coalition

Cutting taxes improves our relationship with the capitalists.

@welfare
on-arrival: welfare -= 1; budget += 1; capital_strike_progress -= 2; new_middle_dvp += 4*(1-dissent); old_middle_dvp += 4*(1-dissent); workers_dvp -= 5; unemployed_dvp -= 5; unemployed -= 1; labor_dissent += 5; spd_relation -= 5;  coalition_dissent += 1 if in_weimar_coalition or in_grand_coalition; inflation -= 1;

Cutting welfare improves our relationship with the capitalists, but it hurts our working-class base.


@nothing

Realistically, there is nothing we can do.

@watch

Presumably, we have an economic plan that will lead us out of the crisis. The capitalists do not trust us, but we will show them eventually.
