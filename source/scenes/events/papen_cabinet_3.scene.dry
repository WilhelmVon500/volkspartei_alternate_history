= <span style="color: #954B00;">**SA**</span> Ban Lifted

The ban on the <span style="color: #954B00;">**SA**</span>, instituted by the previous cabinet, has been lifted in an emergency decree. This is doubtlessly apart of the conditions the [+ nsdap_leader +] attached for the <span style="color: #954B00;">**NSDAP**</span>'s support of the cabinet, as its paramilitary plays a large role in disrupting political meetings and creating an oppressive atmosphere on the streets.

This is met with an instant increase in political violence, with the lifting of the ban being opposed by everyone except the <span style="color: #954B00;">Nazis</span>. This also eliminates the last rationale for continued <span style="color: #954B00;">Nazi</span> support for the unpopular Papen.

The <span style="color: #954B00;">**SA**</span> immediately returns to mass recruiting and arming. This is too much for the Prussian police to handle.
