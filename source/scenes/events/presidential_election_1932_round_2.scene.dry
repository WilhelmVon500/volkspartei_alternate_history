@pres_election

The first round has ended, with no candidate receiving an absolute majority of votes. [+ nsdap_candidate_1932 +]'s results were disappointing to him and his party, [? if not nsdap_candidate = "Hindenburg": but he has chosen to remain as a candidate?][? if nsdap_candidate = "Hindenburg": resulting in him dropping out and supporting Hindenburg instead?]. Th채lmann has also remained in the running, refusing to back what they view as the lesser evil.
