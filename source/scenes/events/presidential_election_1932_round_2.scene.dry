@pres_election

The first round has ended, with no candidate receiving an absolute majority of votes. [+ nsdap_candidate_1932 +]'s results were disappointing to him and his party, [? if not nsdap_candidate = "Hindenburg": but he has chosen to remain as a candidate?][? if nsdap_candidate = "Hindenburg": resulting in him dropping out and supporting Hindenburg instead?]. Thälmann has also remained in the running, refusing to back what they view as the lesser evil.

@hindenburg_wins
on-arrival: president = "Hindenburg"

As expected, the incumbent Hindenburg wins the presidency.

@lettow_vorbeck_wins
on-arrival: president = "Lettow-Vorbeck"

Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, a nationalist not far different from Hindenburg, has been elected president.

@eckener_wins
on-arrival: president = "Eckener"; new_middle_dvp += 5; old_middle_dvp += 5

Nationally renown Zeppelin pilot and independent Hugo Eckener has won the presidency! This is a moment of celebration for our party, as his victory helps keep the Nazis at bay.

@thalmann_wins
on-arrival: president = "Thälmann";

Ernst Thälmann of the KPD has won the presidency.

- @civil_war: This is civil war.

@hitler_wins
on-arrival: president = nsdap_candidate; chancellor = "Hitler"; chancellor_party = "NSDAP"

[? if nsdap_candidate == "Hitler" : Adolf Hitler of the NSDAP has won the presidency. He wastes no time in consolidating power. ?]
[? if nsdap_candidate != "Hitler" : The NSDAP candidate [+ president +] has won. The first action President [+ president +] takes is inviting Hitler back into Germany, and appointing him chancellor. The Nazis waste no time in consolidating power. ?]

- @hitler_takes_power: What do we do now?


@braun_wins
on-arrival: president = "Braun"; workers_spd += 5; old_middle_spd += 3; new_middle_spd += 3; rural_spd += 3; unemployed_spd += 3; pro_republic += 3

Otto Braun of the SPD has won the presidency! This is a moment of celebration for their party, and his victory is able to bolster their support.
