= The Harzburg Front

The far-right parties and paramilitaries - the NSDAP (and its paramilitary the SA), the Stahlhelm paramilitary group, and the DNVP - have united to form the Harzburg Front, as a force dedicated to the overthrow of the current government.

- @denounce_harzburg: We must denounce the far-right parties.
- @stay_silent: Stay relatively silent.
- @attend_harzburg: Attend the meeting.
