= The Death of Hindenburg

President Paul von Hindenburg has passed away at age 86. An era of history is closing, and the future remains to be seen.

The nation engages in an outpouring of grief for its war hero and president, with even some sympathy among committed republicans and socialists. After all, Hindenburg steered the republic through some of its most challenging times, without giving in to extremists on the far right. Perhaps he is one reason democracy remains alive.

New presidential elections are to be held as soon as possible. The German political landscape is wide open, with contenders from all over the political space. In the meantime, Supreme Court chief justice [? if judicial_reform < 4 : Erwin Bumke ?][? if judicial_reform >= 4 : Hermann Großmann ?] serves as the acting president.

# Hermann Großmann is the supreme court chief justice in judicial reform.

- @candidates: Who are the candidates so far?

@candidates
go-to: candidate_menu

[? if not hitler_deported : Of course, Adolf Hitler will be running for the Nazis, in his third run. We have kept him out of power so far, but nothing is certain. ?]
[? if hitler_deported : With Hitler deported, the Nazis will be running Hermann Göring as their candidate. ?]
This might be the Nazis' last hurrah; the party's internal contradictions are heightening, and it is in desperate shortage of funds.

The DNVP will nominate Franz Seldte, leader of the Stahlhelm paramilitary group. He will be endorsed by many of Hindenburg's most right-wing supporters. They are working more closely with the Nazis than before, and in the second round, the far-right parties are expected to consolidate into a single anti-republican front.

[? if kpd_party_leader = "Conciliators" : Given the failure of Thälmann's previous runs for president, and his declining stature in the party, the KPD will be running Willi Münzenberg, a controversial figure sometimes called the "Red millionaire". He is a media magnate who leads a number of Communist front organizations. ?]
[? if kpd_party_leader != "Conciliators" : This will be Ernst Thälmann's third run for president as leader of the KPD. Despite his previous electoral defeats, he retains the loyalty of the party as well as Stalin's Soviet Union. ?]

Many republicans of the Center, [? if not lvp_formed: [+ ddp_name +]?], and SPD float the idea of running Hugo Eckener, a nationally renowed Zeppelin captain, as a unity candidate. While he has some nationalistic views, he is also ardently opposed to Nazism.

Barring that, the Center and SPD are planning to run separate candidates in the first round if the SPD runs its own candidate. The Center is considering nominating Konrad Adenauer, mayor of Köln and member of the Prussian state legislature. He calls for an alliance of conservative Christian democrats that encompasses both Catholics and Protestants. The SPD might nominate Otto Braun, the Prussian Social democrat.

As for the [? if not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #C0A054;">**[+ dvp_name +]**</span> ?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFA500;">**[+ dvp_name +]**</span> ?], we could support a joint Republican candidate or run our own.

Since the presidency has been made a largely ceremonial figure by our reforms, we might set a precedent by nominating a nonpartisan pro-democracy figure from the cultural, scientific, or literary worlds. There are many potential candidates...

Albert Einstein is a Nobel Prize-winning scientist, director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, and international advocate for peace. He was a founding member of the German Democratic Party (whose successor would support him in the election), but has also expressed sympathy towards socialism.

He did not wish to run for president, disliking the public nature of campaigning, but we have somehow convinced him that his candidacy will be crucial to the future of Germany and the world. As a Jewish German pacifist, his becoming president would be a repudiation of everything the Nazis stand for.

The [+ ddp_name +] will endorse Einstein's candidacy.

Heinrich Mann is a world-renowned novelist and poet who is also known to be a left-wing activist. His political sympathy lies with the far left, and he supported the revolutions in 1918 and 1919. He has long lived in the shadow of his better-known brother, Thomas Mann.

Mann is willing to accept the nomination for president.

Carl von Ossietzky is a left-wing journalist who is the publisher of the Weltbühne, a news magazine. He is most known for exposing the secret German rearmament program in 1929, which brought him international renown. In the 1932 presidential election, he endorsed the Communist Thälmann.

Ossietzky is extremely reluctant to become a politician, and has been an iconoclastic figure his entire life, criticizing the SPD as being part of the establishment. It is with a sense of irony that he accepts our nomination.

With Seldte's victory, the balance of power passes to the Nazis.

@hitler_constitutional
view-if: presidential_powers

We have passed a constitutional amendment preventing the president from having the power to arbitrarily dismiss a government. To undo this, the far right has called a plebiscite on a new constitutional amendment. Stormtroopers are in the streets, "convincing" voters to support their proposal. Germany is nearing civil war.

@fight

Do we realize that this means civil war, against the full force of the state?

- @civil_war: Yes.
- @defeat_democratic: It is not too late to fight constitutionally.

on-arrival: constitutional_crisis = 1

Despite the Nazi threats, supporters of the SPD and the democratic parties refuse to turn out for the referendum, depriving it of the necessary threshold to pass. This is a small victory, as stormtroopers still run rampant in the streets. There is no constitutional path to absolute power, but will that stop the Nazis?

# TODO: depose the chancellor?

Thälmann wastes no time in consolidating power, using all means available to reshape the government. In response, the far-right immediately launches a coup attempt. We have no choice but to unite with the KPD against the fascists...

- @civil_war: This is civil war.

@thalmann_democrat

Despite the victory of the anti-constitutionalist Thälmann, he appears to be respecting the constitutional constraints on presidential power, at least for now. There is no appetite on the right for a coup at this moment. The bourgeoisie have to live with a communist president, at least for now.


@munzenberg_victory
achievement: rote_millionar
go-to: nazis_lose

The bourgeois and right-wing parties are up in arms about the prospect of a Communist president, although Münzenberg and the KPD conciliators take pains to assure Germany of their commitment to the democratic republic. There is no energy for a coup against the new president. The bourgeoisie will have to live with whatever comes.

After its electoral defeat, the NSDAP-DNVP coalition is collapsing into infighting and financial insolvency. The far-right's moment has seemingly ended, at least for now.
