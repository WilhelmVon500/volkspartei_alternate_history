= The Death of Gustav Stresemann

Gustav Stresemann, leader of our party and longtime foreign minister, has died at the tragically young age of 51. Without him, the democratic forces in the Republic will be so much weaker.


@votedvp

The <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> is now having an internal party vote to elect a successor to Stresemann.

- @curtius: Julius Curtius
- @scholz: Ernst Scholz
- @hugo: Otto Hugo


@curtius
on-arrival: dvp_leader = "Curtius"; spd_relation += 5; new_middle_dvp += 4; workers_dvp += 1; pro_republic += 3

Julius Curtius has won. The party leadership stays committed to Weimar system.

@scholz
on-arrival: dvp_leader = "Scholz"

Ernst Scholz was elected party leader. He represents compromise between the left and right wings of our party.

@hugo
on-arrival: dvp_leader = "Hugo"; spd_relation -= 10; old_middle_dvp -= 1; new_middle_dvp -= 3; pro_republic -= 3

Otto Hugo has won. He represents a sharp rightward turn from Stresemann.
