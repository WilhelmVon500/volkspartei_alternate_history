= Presidential Election Candidates

With the 1932 German Presidential election coming up next month, we need to decide whether to run a candidate of our own or support Hindenburg. Many are calling for us to support the incumbent Hindenburg. WIP.

On the other hand, some in our party want to run our own candidate. WIP.

Anyhow, let's see who will be the candidates on the campaign trail.

@candidate_selection


- @view_candidates_1: View the running candidates.

@view_candidates_1


- @hindenburg: Hindenburg is, of course, running once more.

@hindenburg
face-image: img/portraits/Hindenburg.jpg

President Hindenburg is, of course, running for re-election, and many in our party are prepared to support him as the [? if dvp_ideology = "Left": last bastion of democracy against Hitler and the Nazis?][? if dvp_ideology = "Right": symbol of German nationalism and patriotism?]. The Hindenburg Mythos serves as a powerful rallying point for all parties, as he maintains high personal popularity despite everything Germany has endured. However, the more support he receives from the German left and center, the more Hindenburg views it as a stain on his personal honor. The refusal of August von Mackensen and other high-ranking officers with whom he served during the war to embrace his candidacy proved particularly painful to the Reich president.

- @harzburg: We await the decision of the Harzburg Front.

@harzburg
go-to: duesterberg

@duesterberg
face-image: img/portraits/DuesterbergTheodor.jpg

The Harzburg Front has nominated the deputy leader of Stahlhelm, Theodor Duesterberg.

- @nsdap_selection: Who will the NSDAP run?

@nsdap_selection
go-to: hitler if not hitler_deported; goring if hitler_deported

@hitler

The Nazis will run Hitler. A victory for Hitler would mean the end of parliamentary democracy, and the beginning of an era of unspeakable horrors.

- @communist: We await the decision of the Communists.

@goring

Since Hitler has been deported, the Nazis will run Hermann Göring in his stead. He is widely seen as a proxy for Hitler, who, despite his legal persecution, retains a popular base who wishes to see him returned to Germany. A victory for him would mean the end of parliamentary democracy, and the beginning of an era of unspeakable horrors.

- @communist: We await the decision of the Communists.

@communist
face-image: img/portraits/ThälmannErnst.jpg

The Communists will run Ernst Thälmann, their leader and candidate in 1925.

- @socialist: We await the decision of the SPD.

@socialist
go-to: braun if spd_candidate = "Braun"; hindenburg_spd if spd_candidate = "Hindenburg"

@braun
face-image: img/portraits/BraunOtto.jpg

The SPD will run Otto Braun, [? if not prussia_leader = "Braun": former ?] Prussian Minister-President and candidate in the 1925 election. [? if ddp_exist and ddp_candidate = spd_candidate: [+ ddp_name +] is expected to support him?][? if z_candidate = "Braun" and ddp_exist:, as well as the Center Party?][? if z_candidate = "Braun" and not ddp_exist: The Center Party is expected to support him?].

- @liberal: So, what is our decision? Should we run our own candidate, or support Hindenburg?

@hindenburg_spd
face-image: img/portraits/Hindenburg.jpg

Despite his known reactionary nature, Hindenburg has at least been keeping the Nazis at bay. The SPD will support him, as a lesser evil.

- @liberal: So, what is our decision? Should we run our own candidate, or support Hindenburg?


@liberal

WIP has been floated around as a candidate for the presidency. WIP.

So, what's our choice?

- @support_hindenburg: Support Hindenburg.
- @run_eckener: Run Hugo Eckener as a unity candidate.
- @support_braun: Support Braun.



@hope

Hopefully, the [+ dvp_candidate +] coalition is strong enough.
