= Panzerkreuzer

The Reichswehr Ministry is demanding the construction of a new battlecruiser, as part of Germany's rearmament. Our coalition partners are united in support. While many of our members are vehemently against new military spending, this vote may be necessary to preserve the coalition. 
We campaigned on food for children instead of battlecruisers. Will we really betray our campaign promises?

- @vote_yes: SPD votes yes, for constructing the battlecruiser.
- @vote_no: SPD votes no, against constructing the battlecruiser.
- @abstain: SPD abstains from the vote.

SPD's grassroots party members are shocked by their intransigence! Many party branches have begun agitating against the cabinet, and our Reichstag members even plan a full vote on the proposal, contravening the government's decision.

The campaign against the battlecruiser fails, with only the dissident SPD and KPD members voting against. The ship will be built.

on-arrival: spd_relation -= 3; panzerkreuzer_funded = 0; nationalism -= 3*(1-dissent); panzerkreuzer_failed = 1; workers_spd += 5*(1-dissent); ddp_cohesion += 1

We and our coalition partners are shocked by SPD's intransigence! However, Chancellor Braun manages to persuade our cabinet ministers to drop the plan to vote on the battlecruiser. The ship will not be built!

@muller
on-arrival: panzerkreuzer_funded = 1

We and our coalition partners are shocked by SPD's intransigence! Despite Chancellor Müller's rejection of the proposal, bourgeois parties bring the matter to a Reichstag vote, which easily passes, with only the SPD and KPD voting against. The ship will be built.

@vote_no_pass
on-arrival: panzerkreuzer_funded = 1

We and our coalition partners are shocked by SPD's intransigence! Chancellor [+ chancellor +] brings the matter to a Reichstag vote, which passes with all parties in favor except the SPD and KPD. The ship will be built.

@abstain
on-arrival: panzerkreuzer_funded = 1; ddp_cohesion -= 1

We and our coalition partners are shocked by SPD's intransigence! Despite their abstention, the vote in the Reichstag goes through, with all parties in favor except the SPD and KPD. The ship will be built.
