= <span style="color: #DCCA4A;">**DDP**</span> Reformation

The <span style="color: #DCCA4A;">**DDP**</span> is a fascinating party, plagued by infighting since the republic's foundation and struggling to define its platform in a failed attempt to appeal to voters from all demographics.[? if stolper_program_adopted: Recently, however, the party seems to have turned a new page, rallying around a renewed focus on middle-class interests. ?][? if not stolper_program_adopted: A recent attempt to shift focus toward the middle class has been quietly buried due to internal dissent, perhaps factionalism and personal rivalries may be a permanent feature of this party. ?]

Pessimism is a widespread feeling within the party, leading to mounting pressure on leader Koch-Weser to do "something". After weeks of secret negotiations, the <span style="color: #DCCA4A;">**DDP**</span> is announcing the result of a proposed merger of the <span style="color: #DCCA4A;">**DDP**</span> and <span style="color: #D3D3A9;">**VNR**</span>.

- @dstp_formed: The <span style="color: #DCCA4A;">**DStP**</span> is formed.
- @status_quo: The negotiations fail.

This has come as a complete shock to those inside and outside the party, for the <span style="color: #DCCA4A;">**DDP**</span> to merge with the political wing of a mildly anti-Semitic paramilitary group "Young German Order".

In this agreement, the <span style="color: #DCCA4A;">**DDP**</span> has promised a "extension of the party to the right". Despite this, the formation of the <span style="color: #DCCA4A;">**DStP**</span> wasn't a simple left-right divide within the party, the Social Republican Circle and labor leader Ernst Lemmer helps prevent a major split among the left.

As expected, a merger between a moderately anti-Semitic organization and a party seen as the party for the Jews has failed, with the Young German Order leader Artur Mahraun leaving negotiations citing irreconcilable differences.

However, internal opposition to Koch-Weser has reached a boiling point. Forces within the party are now pushing for his retirement due to his failure to revive the party.
