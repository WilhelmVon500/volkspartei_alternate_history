# Options: spend relations to reduce coalition_dissent

= Vote of No Confidence

[? if in_grand_coalition : The SPD ?][? if in_bourgeois_coalition or in_right_coalition or in_center_right_coalition or in_minority_government: The Center Party ?] has called for a vote of no confidence against us, due to our various policies and disagreements. If this succeeds, there will be an election in a few months.

- @let_it_happen: Let the vote happen.

@try_assuage

How do we assuage our partners?

- @give_up_prussia: Give up on leadership of Prussia.
- @austerity: Enact a massive austerity plan.
- @resources: Use our resources to reduce dissent within the coalition.
- @let_it_happen: Never mind. Let the vote happen.

@give_up_prussia
view-if: spd_prussia == 1
on-arrival: coalition_dissent = 0; spd_prussia = 0; prussian_government = "I"; reformist_dissent += 10; centrist_dissent += 10; labor_dissent += 10; left_dissent += 5; workers_spd -= 5; rural_spd -= 5; 

Fine. We no longer control the government of Prussia. The vote has been called off.

@austerity
view-if: welfare >= 0 and not secularized
on-arrival: coalition_dissent = 0; workers_spd -= 10; unemployed_spd -= 10; workers_kpd += 7; workers_nsdap += 3; unemployed_kpd += 5; unemployed_nsdap += 5; left_dissent += 15; center_dissent += 10; labor_dissent += 15; reformist_dissent += 5; welfare -= 2; budget += 1; unemployed += 3; kpd_coalition_dissent += 1; kpd_relation -= 10 if in_popular_front

Fine. We enacted a massive austerity program to cut welfare, in order to maintain the stability of our coalition. The vote has been called off.

@resources
view-if: secularized = 0
choose-if: resources >= 3
unavailable-subtitle: We do not have enough resources.
subtitle: -3 resources
on-arrival: resources -= 3; coalition_dissent -= 1;

By transferring resources to our coalition partners, we can reduce their dissent against our policies. This is a crude, but effective solution.

@let_it_happen_hindenburg
on-arrival: chancellor = "Brüning"; chancellor_party = "Z"; welfare -= 2;

The vote succeeds, and our government has resigned. Chancellor Brüning has been appointed as the head of an acting government, consisting solely of the bourgeois parties. He immediately proceeds to cut welfare spending substantially.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

@let_it_happen_braun
on-arrival: spd_caretaker = 1

The vote succeeds, and our government has resigned. Chancellor [+ chancellor +] remains as the head of a caretaker government, but no longer has the power to enact new policies.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].
