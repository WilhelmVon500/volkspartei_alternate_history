Gottfried Treviranus has been elected as leader of the <span style="color: #455B95;">**KVP**</span>, a member of the Young Conservative faction and is supportive of transforming the party into a democratic conservative force. The defeat of the national conservative forces within the <span style="color: #455B95;">**KVP**</span> helps pave the way for Treviranus' vision of a Christian Democratic, albeit nationalist party.
