The Reichstag elections are to be held now.

@cancel_elections
title: We cannot hold the elections now. Cancel the elections.
subtitle: This is an anti-democratic move that may backfire.
view-if: in_emergency_government == 1 and president == "Braun" and not presidential_powers

Since we are currently ruling as part of an emergency government, we may use quasi-constitutional trickery to significantly delay these elections, and continue governing via Article 48. This is likely to be extremely unpopular both with our base and with the other parties. However, this may be necessary to prevent the extremists from gaining power.

- @cancel_elections_2: Yes, do it.
- @election_algorithm: No, let's hold the elections.

Fine. President [+ president +] has taken the unprecedented step of canceling these elections. New elections are scheduled for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

Let us hope this does not backfire.

The reactionary establishment is still very skeptical of the Nazis, so instead, [+ president +] appoints Kurt von Schleicher, a former general, as chancellor, to try to "tame" the Nazis.

Schleicher's government is deeply unpopular among all parties of the Reichstag. Despite his support for a coalition with the NSDAP, the Nazis want power all to themselves, without Schleicher.

President Braun faces a dilemma. Is it "democratic" to let democracy be destroyed, if the majority of voters have willed it so? Some, even on the left, suggest that the Nazis would not *truly* be as horrific as their platform suggests, and that giving them power would let them discredit themselves in the eyes of the public.

Alternatively, Braun could use the emergency powers of the presidency. Article 48 has been used by Hindenburg to promulgate anti-democratic and anti-worker policies; can Article 48 be used for good as well as evil?

There is no path to a majority government. President Hindenburg is tired of the chaos, and appoints Franz von Papen as chancellor instead of BrÃ¼ning. Papen is a indenpendent formerly from the Center Party, and is significantly to the right of the majority of the Center Party.
