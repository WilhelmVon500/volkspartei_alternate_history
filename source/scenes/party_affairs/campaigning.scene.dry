= Campaigning

Whether or not we are in an electoral campaign, the party is always trying to broaden its voter base. Who should we focus our campaign efforts on?

- @workers: The urban working class, who have felt neglected by us in the past.
- @new_middle: The "new middle class" of government employees and white-collar workers, our traditional support base.
- @old_middle: The "old middle class" of small independent businessmen and artisans, our traditional support base.
- @rural: Rural workers and small farmers.
- @unemployed: The unemployed.
- @catholics: Catholics, who typically support the Center Party.
- @root: We either don't want to or cannot campaign right now.
- @easy_discard
