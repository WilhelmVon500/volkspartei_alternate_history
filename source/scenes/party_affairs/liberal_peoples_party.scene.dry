= Building a Liberal People's Party

WIP

- @support_liberal_peoples_party: Yes, we must unite with [+ ddp_name +]!
- @build_support: We must build additional support before uniting with [+ ddp_name +].
- @support_liberal_peoples_party_hard: Despite strong opposition from the Industrialist and Nationalist factions, we will unite with [+ ddp_name +].
- @no_new_ideas: No, we will not do this.
- @root: Perhaps we can discuss this at a later time.

We are pushing forward proposals for a united liberal party against the nationalists within our party. We are also building ties with [+ ddp_name +] organizations.

In a joint emergency conference with [+ ddp_name +], we have decided to unite our parties to become a liberal people's party.

We do not need to unite with [+ ddp_name +]
