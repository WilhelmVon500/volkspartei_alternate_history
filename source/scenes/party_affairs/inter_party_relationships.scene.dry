#subtitle: Building relations with the other political parties of Germany.

= Inter-Party Relationships

The <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> cannot govern by itself yet. Because we do not have an electoral majority, we need the support of other parties. Recently, our governments have consisted of the Bourgeois Coalitions of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>, Center, BVP, and Democratic parties. We can reach out and build additional connections with these parties, or perhaps we can stand alone.

- @liberals: Strengthen our bonds with the left-liberal German Democratic Party
- @center: Strengthen our bonds with the Catholic Center Party.
- @spd: Strengthen our bonds with the Social Democratic Party.
- @dnvp: Strengthen our bonds with the German National People's Party.
- @dvp_alone: The <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> can stand alone for now.

on-arrival: spd_relation += 5*(1 - dissent)

We are currently in opposition to the SPD-led government, but that does not preclude the general building of feelings of good will.

We are currently coalition partners with them, so improving relations comes naturally.

@dvp_alone

Whether it is because we *cannot* or *will not*, we do not make ties with other parties at this moment.

- @return: Continue...
