> *"It is the policy of force which finally will always triumph. But when one has not got the force, one can also combat by the idea."*

 - Gustav Stresemann, 1924

This is a game of alternate history. While historical accuracy is a major concern, keep in mind that this is a *game*, and that any divergence from actual events will necessarily have to involve some element of make-believe. Nevertheless, please let the author know if there are any glaring mistakes.

For more information on the politics and government of the German Republic, see the "Library" page on the top left. If this is your first time playing the game, it is strongly recommended that you read at least some of this information.

= 1928

It is a hopeful moment for German democracy. The hyperinflation crisis that marked the republic’s early years has finally been quelled, and a sense of normalcy is returning. Our leader, Gustav Stresemann, has led the nation’s rapprochement between us and the Allied Powers, and the turmoil that the Great War had inflicted on Europe is slowly fading away.

However, not all is well for us. The center-right coalition headed by Wilhelm Marx’s Zentrum has torn itself apart, and we have been caught in the crossfire. From the sidelines, the SPD awaits to pounce on this opportunity, eating away at the dominance of our fellow business-minded parties.

The coalition has collapsed, mainly due to disagreements with our partners regarding religious schools, and new elections have been called. The next elections are slated for May of this year.
